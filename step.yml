  Deploys app to device farm and starts a test run with a preconfigured test package and device pool.

  This Step requires an Amazon Device Farm registration. To register an account, [click here](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/)

  Use the [aws-device-farm-file-deploy](https://github.com/peartherapeutics/bitrise-aws-device-farm-file-deploy) step to upload your latest test package (and extra app data if required) before this step runs.

          If set to true, the script waits for the test run to complete on
          Devicefarm before returning success/failure. This will slow down your
          Bitrise runs, however allows you to make decisions in subsequent steps
          based on success/failure of the tests.

          Depending on your tests, you may or may not wish to fail the step if
          DeviceFarm returns a WARNED result. Only takes effect if
          run_wait_for_results is also enabled.
